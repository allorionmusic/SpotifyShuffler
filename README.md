# SpotifyShuffler
My personal favorite python script to shuffle my spotify playlist

To use it you will need to put every song link in the lines of spotify.txt

To do it is pretty simple, just go to your playlist in the desktop app and ctrl + a to select all songs, then ctrl + c to copy it!

You can ctrl + a, right click and select "Remove from playlist" to remove all the songs 

Then you just run the script and ctrl + v to paste into the playlist!

# Note
some random line in spotify.txt will be merged with another, for example, a link will be like this:

https://open.spotify.com/track/3gnZKWRE06LCcCXpu487bXhttps://open.spotify.com/track/2lOg3OFSkrgfh9v4VZerZj

so you just hit enter in the second https to fix it
