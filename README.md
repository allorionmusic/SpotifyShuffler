# SpotifyShuffler
My personal favorite python script to shuffle my spotify playlist

To use it you will need to put every song link in the lines of spotify.txt
To do it is pretty simple, just go to your playlist in the desktop app and ctrl + a to select all songs, then ctrl + c to copy it!
You can ctrl + a, right click and select "Remove from playlist" to remove all the songs 
Then you just run the script and ctrl + v to paste into the playlist!
